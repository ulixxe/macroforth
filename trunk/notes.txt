* Introduction

This is not MacroForth documentation!  For documentation see README.txt.
Here I document various problems and experience with using/implementing a
cross forth compiler trying to adhere to the draft standard at

* Scopes

** problem with target scope :

*** definition in XCapp5.PDF pretty strict

how handle of compilation helper words?  We already pull commenting words into
compiling wordlist.  Also need to pull them into interpreting wordlist?
(immediate = executing during interpretation and compilation).

we need at least \ ( [IF], HEX DECIMAL

section names and types also go into interpreting wordlist.

according to XCtext5.PDF :

x.6.1.nnn SECTION
Skip leading space delimiters. Parse name delimited by a space. Create a
definition name in the host only [...]

host does not mean host scope?!

SECTION goes into host wordlist.

** the need for zombies in addition to ghosts:

according to XCapp5.PDF :

Standard data objects defined in TARGET scope are also available in
the *INTERPRETER wordlist.

hmm.

* No wordlists available for cross-compilation

In a naive implementation, wordlists are used for scope implementation are not
available to the application writer.

When using (3rd party)libraries, it is not possible to use wordlists for
preventing naming collisions.  Some oo Forth systems cannot be ported for
cross forth.

Add wordlist support to target scope?  In interpreter scope, we might then
need search-wordlist?
